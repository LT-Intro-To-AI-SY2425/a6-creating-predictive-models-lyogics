# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model? The r squared value is 0.6257932855322312. This indicates that the linear regression model's two variables are strongly positively correlated, as r is just over 0.79.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old? According to my model, the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old is 136.52043597 mmHg.

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model? I think the model's predictions are pretty accurate because blood pressure increases with age, since the arteries stiffen up over time. However, I do not think the model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age because it lacks other external factors, such as diet, stress levels, and overall health. To improve the model, other independent variables can be added to support the data.
