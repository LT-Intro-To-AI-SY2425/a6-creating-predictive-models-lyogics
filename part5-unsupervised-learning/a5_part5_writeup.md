# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label. "Stingy" - High annual income, low spending score
"Shopaholic" - High annual income, high spending score
"Savers" - Low annual income, low spending score
"Unpredictable" - Low annual income, high spending score
"Moderate" - Medium annual income, medium spending score

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in? A customer who has a medium income and low spending habits would be in the "Stingy" group, or high "Moderate".

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?

The "Unpredictable group stands out to me, because the marketing team would most likely approach this group with false senses of needing specific items. The marketing could always prime customers of this group to buy something because they "need" it.
