# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson? The addition of multiple data sets makes this model more effective than the model I created previously because there is an almost concrete level of accuracy we can gauge given a training and testing set.


2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model? The R squared coefficient indicates that the model is somewhat accurate, since the r squared value is relatively a medium amount. 


3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure. I would say that the model is not as accurate as it could be. While the x-value 64's predicted y value only differed by about 2 mmHg (pretty accurate), the x-value 59's predicted y value differed by almost 15 mmHg, which could really make a difference. When it comes to blood pressure measurements, that amount of mmHg could easily make the difference when identifying potential diseases and conditions, so the model isn't nearly as accurate as desired.
